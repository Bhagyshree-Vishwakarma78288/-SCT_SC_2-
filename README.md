Project-2, Task-2 as part of my SkillCraft Technology Internship. In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.  

I explored relationships between variables like Age, Sex, and Pclass, and identified key patterns and trends in the data. I’m grateful for this opportunity to enhance my skills in data analysis, visualization, and statistical insights. Thank you, SkillCraft, for this amazing learning experience! 🙏
